minibatch unneccessary due to the data size not exceededing 10k


Now - Code for Friday, remember to do the aims post for the meeting
Friday after meeting - do Internships
Weekend - Amoung also coding, do catch up for stuff missed, including sec lab, just review and understand the concepts



probably mention who you used methods to check the accuracy versus generalisation, talk about cross fold validaiton
	This can be done in an and statement within a for loop
	-One method would be to run the validation set and in the change is too great then its over fitted


idea, show all the sillhoutte graphs on the same graph , to show the range of displays


see the variability between his model and mine, can basically use wss I have already in the algorithm, look at
other variance functions aswell

average the cluster, and try grouping

can tell that obviously going by individual data point cluster group classifcations the kmeans method proves superior

do the same mode method on the data and then run it through the kmeans algorithm to produce anohter discussion point, eg: lable by cluster
rather then group

when making a point using the data collected, try to find another source that would co-oberate that same conclusion to give greater validity to it

have to go through the code later and make it cleaner, eg: variable names, have to also make the code run by the input point of the ANN model that I
orginally made, so you put in all the parameters and it just works
	-might also be useful to split up the code into separate functions
	-add comments explaining what each part does - try to make it look like the other comments on the code for cleanliness
